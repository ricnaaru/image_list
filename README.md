# Image List

This is an Image List to display image from phone with the smoothest UI

There's still so much features that I haven't included such as video previewing, image cropping, etc.

## Installation

First, add `image_list` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

This plugin is made to support my other plugin [adv_image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/adv_image_picker#-readme-tab-), you can see that its permission is handled there.

## Example
You can find the full example, [here]([https://github.com/ricnaaru/image_list/tree/master/example](https://github.com/ricnaaru/image_list/tree/master/example))

## Future developments
- Image cropping
- Video display
- More testing and bug fixing

## Support
This repository isn't maintained that well, but I will try to keep it well-maintained as much as possible. Please consider support me..
